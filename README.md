# Food_Donation_App

Welcome to  the Food Donation App! It simplifies the process of donating surplus food and connecting it with those in need. Donors can easily contribute food items, while individuals and organizations can request and receive donations through the receiver section. Clear instructions are provided to guide users through the app's functionalities, ensuring a smooth experience for everyone. Additionally, our contact section allows users to communicate directly with the administrators for any inquiries or assistance. Let's work together to make a positive impact on hunger in our communities.
